# What I Use

## Computer and Peripherals
- Macbook M1 Pro
	- This is long due for an upgrade. This started as a work laptop and has taken over as an "everything" laptop.
    - I love it! 
- MX Master S3
	- This has become essential for how I work, it feels weird to use anything else.
- Apple Magic Keyboard
	- I don't like that I enjoy this keyboard as much as I do. I used a Kinesis Advantage 2 for many years and have been recently been playing with a Glove80 colemak-dh keyboard but I just keep coming back to the Magic Keyboard. I'm very sensitive to key travel and the Magic Keyboard just feels good. Yes, I am concerned about the long term ergonomics.
- LG 27" 4k Monitor
	- 4k is just awesome.

## Office Furniture
- Random Ikea desk chair
	- It's not comfortable and that's intentional!
- Flexispot E7 Plus Standing Desk
	- Incredibly sturdy, there is no noticeable wobble even when using the casters. A great desk that I definitely recommend.

## Audio 
- Airpod Pro 2
- Grado SR80i
	- I love the Grado sound. 
    - If these broke I would potentially look at upgrading them to a better Grado headphone.
- Moondrop Quarks with Final Audio Type E silicon eartips
	- The eartips are a huge jump in comfort. I had an extra laying around from an old pair of earbuds and swapped out the Moondrop tips with these.
	- These are my go-to earbuds for long meetings, I find I can wear them for hours on end without any discomfort and the Quarks are cheap enough that I don't feel bad about abusing them
- Apple Music
	- Lossless ALAC
	- Migrated away from Spotify after one too many UI redesigns. Apple's focus on the album as a first-class entity in their design choice, as opposed to individual songs, has been a breath of fresh air.

# Smartphone and Apps
- iPhone SE 2021
	- I believe that cellphones are slowly poisoning our souls. This phone is cracked and beaten but that only serves as a further deterrent against doom-scrolling and useless YouTube binging. 
	- All social media apps have been removed and all social media websites are blocked via parental controls.
    - I have had the same background since 2010.
- Firefox Focus
	- This is the only mobile browser I use.
	- Default search engine is DuckDuckGo.
	- By removing Safari and only using Focus, multitasking becomes very difficult (which is the point).


# E-Reader
- Boox Note5
	- My favorite piece of tech I own! If it broke today, I would buy a replacement tomorrow.
	- I love the screen real-estate which allows for split screen reading + note taking.
    - E-ink is the future, I want e-ink everything.
- KoReader
	- Dark mode is a must for reading at night
- Calibre
	- It just works.
- Staedtler Noris Digital Jumbo Stylus
	- I'm not that picky when it comes to styluses. I like that the back of the pencil is and eraser.
